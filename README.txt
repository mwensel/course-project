This code reads data from the UCI HAR dataset as long as it is in the user's working directory, cleaning it into a tidy dataset. The code works by first taking test and train data and reading it into R, the row-binding the two sets into one data frame. Variable names are imported from the features.txt file and added to the row-binded dataframe. Subject data is then imported for test and train data , row-binded together, then column binded to the existing data frame. The same process is undergone for activity, and the columns are named.  Variables for activity are reassigned to character vectors to better explain the data. The data is then scanned using the grepl function to find which columns contain data on standard deviation and mean, and these columns are extracted along with the columns representing subject and activity. Subject and activity are then factored, and combined into a list which is passed to the “by” command to find the mean of each column in the final data. The data comes out in a tidy, narrow format. Unforunately I was not able to figure out how to coerce the resulting “by” class object into a data frame, and as a result was unable to write the now tidy data to a table.
